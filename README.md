# YOLOv5 Object Detection Russian Vehicles

Huge thanks to:
 - Glen Jocher for developing such a sophisticated and user friendly architecture and model...not to mention his teams active responses on the forums.  
 - Hippalla for providing his data set. Would not have been possible without his generousity.
 
Here, I implement a deep learning model that is able to, once trained, take in images or video (or URL) locate Russian military vehicles within an image/video and classify the vehicle type. Leveraging a deep learning model to predict potential vehicle types (at some probability) from the deluge of social media posts can dramatically reduce the subsequent workload required for human curation and analysis.
