# YOLOv5 Object Detection with Russian Military Vehicles

Huge thanks to:
 - Glen Jocher (https://docs.ultralytics.com/) for developing such a sophisticated and user friendly architecture and model...not to mention his (or his team's) active responses on the forums.  
 - Tuomo Hiippala (https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/thiippal/) for providing his data set. This project would not have been possible without his generousity.
 
Leveraging a deep learning model to predict types of Russian military vehicles from the deluge of social media posts can dramatically reduce the subsequent workload required for human curation and analysis. Here, I implement a deep learning model (YOLOv5) that is able to, once trained, take in images or video (or URL) locate Russian military vehicles within an image/video and classify the vehicle type.
